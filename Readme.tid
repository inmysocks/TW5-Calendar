!The calendar-month widget

Content of the `<$calendar-month>` widget is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|year |The year that the month displayed is from. It must be in 4 digit YYYY format and has no default value. |
|month |The month to display. See list below for valid month values. month has no default value. |
|day_macro |(optional) The macro that defines the content of each calendar day. It is passed the parameters `day`, `month`, `year` and `dayOfTheWeek` with the correct values for the current day of the month. Defaluts to `CalendarListDailyThings` defined in [[Calendar Default Macros|$:/plugins/OokTech/Calendar/Calendar Default Macros]] |
|weekstart |Set equal to Sunday or Monday to specify the first day of the week, defaults to Monday. |
|class |(optional) A css class to use. Defaults to the class `calendar-table` defined in [[Calendar Table Style|$:/plugins/OokTech/Calendar/Calendar Table Style]] |

!The default ~CalendarListDailyThings macro

This macro lists any tiddlers that have fields called `day`, `month` and `year` in the matching calendar day. If you click on a cell than a tiddler with a title in the form of (day)-(month)-(year) is opened.

!Making custom day macros

The macro is put inside each day of the month and passed the appropriate values for day, month, year and dayOfTheWeek. 

*`day` is the day of the month and will be in the range [1,31].
*`month` is given as a number in the range [1,12] where 1 is January and 12 is December.
*`year` is the 4 digit year value and is the same as the value passed to the widget
*`dayOfTheWeek` is a number representing the day of the week, if you have the week starting on Monday than Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6, if you have the week start on Sunday than Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6

One of the simplest macros would be:

```
\define SimpleCalendarDayMacro(day month year dayOfWeek)
$day$
\end
```

which just displays the current date in each day on the calendar.

When you make a macro for the calendar remember that you either need to put it in a tiddler tagged with `$:/tags/Macros` or you need to put the macro in the same tiddler where you use the calendar widget.
